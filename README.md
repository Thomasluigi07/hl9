# HALF-LIFE 9 (Game)
A very unfinished Half-Life fangame/parody/rip-off/bootleg I made to test the Godot Engine.


I originally planned to release an update for the game on the 19th of November, 2024 for the original Half-Life's 26th anniversary, but I completely forgot about the game and ended up not working on it... and I also forgot to release the source code. Whoops!

You can find the update plans I had in the UPDATE.rtf file.
